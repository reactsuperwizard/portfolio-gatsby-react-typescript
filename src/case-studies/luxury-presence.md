        Luxury Presence wanted to remaster their website’s builder design and functionality, which required dramatic changes to both the UI and the underlying legacy React codebase.

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
      The project had strict requirements. For the Website Builder implementation, the Graphql backend was complete and the FE needed to be implemented with React/Apollo/styled-components.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge was also in the massive cohesion the application had in it, leading to a sensible situation in which one change (in the code for example) could possibly disrupt the functionality of another part of the website.

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
      Instead of changing all the components and pages at once, I took a step-by-step process, accompanied by careful testing after every major change, that led to a smooth and stable remastering of both the website builder part of the platform and the users dashboard.
      </p>
      <p>
      - The Dashboard has seen one of the biggest changes in the UI of all the parts remastered. A new, brighter and more contrasted UI was implemented, with more intuitive calls to actions and less cognitive load for the user. <br />
      - The Flat 2.0 UI strategy was adopted to give the UI a clean, sleek and modern look, fit for the Luxury Presence’s business model and target audience.
