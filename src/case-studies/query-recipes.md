        Query.Recipes helps marketers automate their day-to-day data analysis work by unleashing the power of Google Sheets, Data Studio, and BigQuery.

        Query.Recipes needed a website redesign and additional features added to their website in order to present their services in the best light possible.

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
      In order to provide the best possible experience for Query.Recipes users, I used React to redesign some of the websiteâ€™s pages and created complex tables that include pagination and filtering. The tables needed to be up-to-date because of the big loads of data that they loaded and displayed. All the data shown in tables were uploaded using GraphQL.

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
      Because the application was already in production and used by customers, there was an emphasis on making things work seamlessly while not disturbing the current flow of the app. I have applied atomic design concepts for my components and tried to keep the presentation layer separated from the logic layer as much as possible so that it becomes more reusable. The code was covered by unit tests and documented using Storybook.
